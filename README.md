# Diabetes Risk Prediction

This project models the probability of diabetes diagnosis using historical health data.
The goal is to apply statistical learning methods to predict individual risk while
emphasizing model interpretability, evaluation, and uncertainty.

## Overview
The analysis focuses on building classification models to estimate diabetes risk based
on demographic and clinical features. Data preprocessing, feature selection, and model
evaluation are central components of the workflow.

## Methods
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Feature engineering and variable selection
- Probabilistic classification models
- Model evaluation using multiple performance metrics

## Evaluation
Models were assessed using:
- ROC-AUC
- Confusion matrix
- Calibration analysis

These metrics were used to evaluate both predictive accuracy and reliability of risk
estimates.

## Tools
- Python
- pandas
- scikit-learn

## Relevance
This project demonstrates applied risk modeling, classification under uncertainty, and
model evaluation—skills directly relevant to actuarial work in health, insurance pricing,
and predictive risk assessment.
